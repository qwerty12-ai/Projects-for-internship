# My CS50x Final Project: Custom Website Generator

Hello and welcome to my first official web project! ðŸŽ‰ This is my final project for **CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science**, and it's something I'm really proud of. For the first time, Iâ€™ve built an entire web application from scratchâ€”**a website generator** where you can create your very own customizable websites!

## What is this project?

In a nutshell, this is a web app that lets you generate simple HTML websites based on your preferences. You can choose:
- **Website type** (e.g., Portfolio, Blog)
- **Color theme** (Light or Dark)
- **Sections** (About, Gallery, Contact)

The app will then dynamically generate an HTML page with the sections you selected, styled with Bootstrap, and stored in a simple **SQLite** database. Youâ€™ll also be able to look back at a history of the websites youâ€™ve created, so you can keep track of all your awesome creations.

## Features

- **Create Custom Websites**: Select the type of website, its color theme, and the sections you want to include. The app generates HTML based on your choices.
- **Database Storage**: Every website you create is saved to an SQLite database, making it easy to revisit them later.
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap is used to make sure all generated websites look great on any screen size.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: The app is super user-friendly with simple forms to help you quickly generate your site.
- **History Tracking**: View a list of all your previous website creations along with details like website type, color theme, and selected sections.

## How it works

1. **Fill out the form**: Start by choosing the type of website you want (portfolio, blog, etc.), pick a color theme, and select sections like About, Gallery, or Contact.

2. **Database Storage**: Once you submit the form, your choices are saved in an **SQLite database**. This allows you to go back and see a history of all the websites you've created.

3. **Website Generation**: After you submit the form, the app will generate a custom HTML file with your chosen details. The page will be styled using **Bootstrap 4**, and you can download or view the page right away.

4. **View Past Creations**: You can also visit the **History page** to view all the websites youâ€™ve made so far, including the sections youâ€™ve selected for each one.

## Tech Stack

- **Flask**: This Python web framework powers the back-end of the app, handling everything from routing to database queries.
- **SQLite**: I used SQLite to store the websites users create. It's lightweight, easy to use, and perfect for this project.
- **HTML & CSS**: HTML is used to structure the websites, and CSS is for styling. I also used **Bootstrap** for responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Minimal JavaScript is included, mostly to handle form submission and interactivity.
- **Bootstrap 4**: This framework was used to make sure everything looks great on any screen size (phones, tablets, desktops).

## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how the project is organized:

.
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                  # The main Python file
â”œâ”€â”€ websites.db             # The SQLite database that stores all the website data
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/              # This folder contains the HTML templates
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base.html           # The base layout for the app (navbar, footer, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # The homepage where users create their website
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ generated.html      # The page showing the generated HTML for your website
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ history.html        # The page displaying all saved websites
â””â”€â”€ static/                 # This folder contains a single CSS file
    â””â”€â”€ style.css           # Custom CSS file for the styling of the web app


## Future Improvements

While Iâ€™m really proud of what Iâ€™ve built so far, there are a few areas I plan to improve and expand upon as I continue to work on this project. These potential enhancements will make the application more robust, flexible, and user-friendly:

1. **User Authentication**:
   Currently, users can create websites, but the app doesnâ€™t support user authentication. Adding login and registration functionality would allow users to save their websites under their accounts and access them from any device, providing a more personalized experience.

2. **Increased Customization Options**:
   Right now, the website generator allows users to select a few basic options (e.g., website type, theme, and sections). To improve flexibility, I plan to add more customization features, such as the ability to choose fonts, upload custom images, and change layout styles.

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   The current version of the app does not have much in the way of error handling. In the future, I want to implement better form validation, ensuring users are prompted with clear messages when fields are incomplete or incorrectly filled. This will create a smoother experience for users, particularly those who may not be familiar with web development.

4. **More Templates and Themes**:
   Right now, users can choose between a few predefined website types and color themes. To make the app more appealing and versatile, I plan to add a wider variety of templates, themes, and sections (e.g., Testimonials, Blog, Services) to give users more control over their website's design.

5. **Mobile Optimization**:
   Although the app uses **Bootstrap 4** for responsive design, I plan to further optimize the generated websites for mobile devices. This could involve fine-tuning the CSS or adding custom media queries to improve the user experience on smaller screens.

6. **Website Preview Before Generation**:
   Another feature Iâ€™d like to implement is a preview of the website before it is generated. Users would be able to see a mock-up of their website based on their selected options, which would help them visualize the final result before committing to the creation process.

7. **Use of openai in python**:
    Another feature i came across is to import packages related to the openai and artificial intelligence which convert any given prompt for a website and within seconds you have the exact website.
    In my project i only provide template for a generic website which can cut some slack off people who wanna start a website but don't wanna do it from scratch.

These improvements will help take this project to the next level, and Iâ€™m excited to continue working on it as I learn more and gain experience in web development.

## Final Thoughts
This is my very first "official" project outside of the problem sets in CS50, and it was such a fun and rewarding experience. I learned a lot along the way, especially how to integrate databases with Flask, work with HTML and CSS, and make something functional that others can use. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed building it!
