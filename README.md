# Projects-for-internship
Hello ! My name is mohd abdul sabeeh and i am an aspiring web developer who is currently learning backend but have completed a set of projects in frontend using html, css , js and react. i have also included a full stack project which involves using flask html css too.
this is a compilation of all my web development projects that i have made to date and i tried to the best of my knowledge to deploy projects and i have made some errors which i will rectify later on as i continue to understand deployment as i gain more practical expertise.

## Spotify inspired music player:

an clone inspired by spotify to create a personal music player i didnt know how to make my songs public by hosting it 

## react based chatbot:
it is currently in development;needs to be refined more but has implemented state and hooks in react.js hence it is still placed in localhost and is placed under chatbot folder

## website generator:
an personal final project of cs50x with an detailed readme inside its folder made by using html. css and flask alltogether to provide fast template of website to users. I couldnt deploy this project as i dont have understanding of deploying projects for free (only for full stack websites).
