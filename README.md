# Projects-for-internship
Hello ! My name is mohd abdul sabeeh and i am an aspiring web developer who is currently learning backend but have completed a set of projects in frontend using html, css , js and react. i have also included a full stack project which involves using flask html css too.
this is a compilation of all my web development projects that i have made to date and i tried to the best of my knowledge to deploy projects and i have made some errors which i will rectify later on as i continue to understand deployment as i gain more practical expertise.

an personal final project of cs50x with an detailed readme inside its folder made by using html. css and flask alltogether to provide fast template of website to users. I couldnt deploy this project as i dont have understanding of deploying projects for free (only for full stack websites).
