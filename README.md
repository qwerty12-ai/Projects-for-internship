Hi! I’m **Mohd Abdul Sabeeh**, an aspiring full-stack web developer currently sharpening my backend skills. Alongside, I’ve completed several frontend projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and MongoDB—including a full-stack project that leverages Flask, HTML, and CSS.

This repo is a collection of my web development projects to date. I’ve made my best efforts to deploy these projects, and while some deployments might still need polishing, I’m actively learning and improving my deployment skills as I gain more practical experience.
